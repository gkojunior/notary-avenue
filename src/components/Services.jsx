				Please note: Providing the wrong type of document, failing to supply
				required witnesses, or requesting the wrong type of notarial service
				does not constitute an error on the notaryâ€™s part. By law, a
				non-attorney notary cannot explain or interpret the contents of any
				documents for you, instruct you on how to complete a document or direct
				you on the advisability of signing a particular document. Please make
				sure to seek guidance from the requesting agency or an attorney
				regarding any legal questions or advice you may have.
